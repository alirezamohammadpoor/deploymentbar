# Personal Access Token (PAT)

If your Vercel OAuth app does not have API permissions, you can use a personal access token instead.

1. Create a Vercel personal access token in your Vercel account settings.
2. Open VercelBar Settings → Personal Token.
3. Paste the token and click **Save Token**.

Notes:
- Tokens are stored securely in the macOS Keychain.
- If you later want OAuth, click **Clear Token** and sign in again.
